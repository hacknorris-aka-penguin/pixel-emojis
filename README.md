pixeled emojis
---
yes, page your now looking at doesn't contain any code...

... but i think it doesn't mean that it can't be it that place 

![](/imgs/faces/proud.png)

and yes :
- they're 25/20px (all)
- they're all made in funny retro style ![](/imgs/faces/sick.png)
- some of them are even in deep dark style (work in progress, only a few)...
- similar to gamejolt emojis but... less eye-paining ( ![](/imgs/shades_and_colors/green.png) vs ![](/imgs/shades_and_colors/yellow.png) )

and a small 'table of contents' :

| content  |  numbers |
|---------------|--------------|
|faces: | about a ton but i don't know yet if i made all ( about 80 ? )
|arrows: | i think all, but it might not yet be all... (now about 17)
|colors: | 6 (black, white, pink, blue, yellow and green)
|shades: | i think all are made (16 of them )
|numbers: | all, from 0-9
|letters: | all uppercase (26)
|dots: | i think i made 20 ...
|other: | a bunch - they're many so i didn't yet counted

my task list for ths project:
- [x] publish repo 
- [x] rename emojis, so people won't type random numbers when embedding them 
- [x] tidy up a little ?
- [ ] add next 100 emojis
- [ ] add next 250 emojis
- [ ] make over thousand emojis
- [ ] make a webpage for this
- [ ] make also font
- [ ] add these emojis to that font
- [ ] also make icon pack for android
- [ ] also make icon pack for linux
- [ ] also make icon pack for winterboard (old jailbroken ios themes)

how they look like:
| | |
|---|---|
| ![](/imgs/faces/proud.png) | ![](/imgs/faces/hug.png) 
| ![](/imgs/faces/sick.png) | ![](/imgs/faces/centered-small-face.png)

as you see - it's 'work in progress' so PR's and issues can help me in fully creating that faster ![](/imgs/faces/weird.png)
